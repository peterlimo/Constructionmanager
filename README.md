## Abstract

Constructions and renovation usually exceed the initially planned time. Many of the delays are caused due the lack of organization from the project executors, which could be avoided if management was enforced more efficiently. This project perform a research about information systems for construction management and develops an open source mobile application which helps to control the stages on constructions and renovations. This project also describes alternatives, raises requirements and documents the app’s implementation. This work’s motivation is to provide a free mobile application that helps engineers and surveyors to manage constructions and prevent possible delays on their projects.
